<h1>Field Inspection App</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>FieldInspection is a mobile application designed for field inspection tasks. It enables users to collect data while working offline using a SQLite database. The collected data can later be synchronized with the Seed Tracking API when an internet connection is available.</p>

<h3>Features<h3>
<h5>Offline Data Collection: </h5> Field inspectors can perform their tasks and collect inspection data even in areas with no internet connectivity. The app utilizes a local SQLite database to store the collected data.

<h5>Data Synchronization:</h5> When the user is back online, the app allows them to synchronize the collected data with the Seed Tracking API. This ensures that all data is securely stored and accessible from the central database.

<h5>Field Inspection Forms:</h5> The app provides customizable field inspection forms tailored to specific tasks. Inspectors can fill out the forms with relevant information during their inspections.

<h5>Photo Capture:</h5> Field inspectors can capture photos directly from within the app and associate them with inspection records. Photos serve as visual evidence and aid in documentation.

<h5>GPS Location Tracking:</h5> The app records the GPS location of each inspection, providing precise location data for the fieldwork.

Offline Data Storage: All collected data is stored securely in the local SQLite database, ensuring that inspection records are not lost, even when there is no internet connection.

User Authentication: To ensure data security, the app requires user authentication for accessing and modifying inspection data. Each user has specific access permissions based on their role.

Data Export and Reporting: Users can export inspection data in various formats (e.g., CSV, Excel) and generate reports for further analysis and reporting.

Technologies Used
React Native: The app is built using React Native, a popular JavaScript framework for building cross-platform mobile applications.

SQLite Database: The app utilizes SQLite, a lightweight and embedded database, to store the inspection data locally on the mobile device.

Seed Tracking API: The app communicates with the Seed Tracking API to synchronize the collected data with the central database.

Redux: Redux is used for state management, ensuring a consistent and predictable data flow throughout the app.

React Navigation: React Navigation handles navigation and routing within the app, providing a smooth user experience.

Camera API: The Camera API is used to enable photo capture directly from the app.

Geolocation API: The Geolocation API is used to track and record GPS location data during inspections.

User Authentication System: The app implements a user authentication system to manage user access and data security.
